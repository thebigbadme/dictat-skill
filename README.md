Dictate text to the currently opened window (intended for use on pc)

## About
After enabled "dictation mode", all text will be sent to the active application.

TODO: without a PC, the message should be saved as plain text for later access, e.g. sent via mail or reminded at certain time

## Examples
* "Begin dictation"
* "Take me home country roads"
* "Stop dictating"
